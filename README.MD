Features:

- iframe on the top of youtube links

Future Plan:

- let the iframe not update when the videoid is the same as the listed one (currently if it is removed, the iframe will not load)
- Youtube Player API intergration
- embedded youtube pages as well (video embedded, but not youtube.com link)
- turn the function on and off
